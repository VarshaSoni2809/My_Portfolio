<b>This project is a reflection of my journey in web development and showcases
the skills, projects, and experiences I've gained along the way.<b>
<br>
My portfolio embodies a clean and minimalistic design aesthetic, allowing
visitors to focus on the content and projects without distraction.
<br><br>
I’ve leveraged HTML’s structure and semantics to create well-organized and
accessible web pages that are easy to navigate and understand.
<br>
Continuously expand my skillset beyond HTML to include CSS, JavaScript, and
other advanced technologies to create even more dynamic and compelling web
experiences
